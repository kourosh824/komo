# KOMO: your movie companion

KOMO is a powerful movie search engine with lots of exciting features (that will be added). It is powered by ReactJS and uses OMDb API to fetch movie data. KOMO gives you the ability to create your own account, make watch lists and edit them later. We use Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore for this purpose. Detailed comments exist in each JS file and should give you an idea of how this whole project is actually working.
